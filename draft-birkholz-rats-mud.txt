                    MUD-Based RATS Service Discovery
                     draft-birkholz-rats-mud-latest

Abstract

   Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) files and the MUD URI that point
   to them are defined in RFC 8520.  This document introduces a new type
   of MUD file to be delivered in conjunction with a MUD file signature
   and/or to be referenced via a MUD URI embedded in an IEEE 802.1AR
   Secure Device Identifier (DevID).  A DevID is a device specific pub-
   key identity document that can be presented to other entities, e.g. a
   network management system.  If this entity is also a verifier as
   defined by the IETF Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS)
   architecture, this verifier can use the references found in the MUD
   file specified in this document in order to discover appropriate
   Reference Integrity Measurements (RIM), Endorsement Documents, or
   even globally suitable Remote Attestation Services (RAS).  All three
   types of theses resources are required to conduct RATS.  Hence, the
   MUD file defined in this document enables remote attestation
   procedures by supporting the discovery of these required resources or
   services.

1.  Introduction

   Verifiers, Endorsers, and Attesters are roles defined in the RATS
   Architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  In the RATS architecture,
   the Attester role relies on the Verifier and Endorser roles to enable
   the appraisal of Attestation Evidence produced by said Attesters; and
   to create corresponding Attestation Results.  Attestation Results
   compose a believable chunk of information that can be digested by

   Relying Parities in order to assess an Attester's trustworthiness.
   The assessment of a remote peer's trustworthiness is vital to steer
   any future protocol interaction between the Attester and the remote
   Relying Party.  To create these Attestation Results to be consumed by
   Relying Parties, the Attestation Evidence an Attester creates has to
   be processed by one or more appropriate Verifiers.

   This document defines a procedure that enables the discovery of
   viable resources for RATS services in a local scope: 1.)  Reference
   Integrity Measurements, and 2.)  Endorsement documents.

   Additionally, a third option is provided: this document defines the
   option to enable the discovery of remote Verfiers: 3.)  Remote
   Attestation Services (RAS) in a global scope (if no local trusted
   authorities are available).

   Attestation Policies and Endorsements are required to enable an
   appropriate appraisal of Attestation Evidence in a fashion that helps
   Relying Parties to digest the corresponding Attestation Results.
   This document defines the use of MUD URIs embedded in Secure Device
   Identifiers (IEEE 802.1AR DevIDs) as defined by [RFC8520].  These
   DevIDs are enrolled on the Attester by manufacturers or related
   supply chain entities with appropriate authority.  The DevIDs can be
   presented to local Network Management Systems, AAA-services (e.g. via
   IEEE 802.1X), or other points of first contact (e.g.  [RFC8071]) in a
   local scope.  These local entities of authority can digest the DevID
   and conduct trust decisions based on the DevID by tracing associated
   certification paths and trust anchors [RFC4949].  If the DevID
   presented by the Attester is deemed to be trusted by the local trust
   authority, the MUD URI embedded is considered to be a trusted source
   of viable (and if their Identity Documents are also to be trusted -
   believable) Attestation Policies, Endorsements, and even globally
   available RAS.

   In essence, the MUD file that is referenced by the DevID presented
   refers to sources of Attestation Policies and Endorsements
   recommended by the manufacturer or related supply chain entities with
   appropriate authority.  These sources are required by appraisal
   procedures conducted by Verifiers in order to create well-founded
   Attestation Results.  For example, trusted Endorses can enrich
   Attestation Results by vouching for the quality of hardware
   components, the composition of a Composite Attester, or other
   security characteristics of an Attester.

   This specification does not define the format of Attestation Policies
   and Endorsement documents.  A type of Attestation Policies and their
   representation is defined in [I-D tbd].  A specific format of

   Endorsements for hardware components based on [I-D.ietf-rats-eat] is
   defined in [I-D tbd].

1.1.  Requirements Notation

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  MUD URIs in DevIDs

   The MUD URI embedded in a DevID presented by an Attester points to a
   MUD file.  [RFC8520] defines the format of how to embed MUD URIs in
   Secure Device Identifiers.  This document uses this specification and
   does neither modify nor augment the definition about how to compose a
   MUD URI.

3.  MUD File Signatures

   As the resources required by a Verifier's appraisal procedures have
   to be trustworthy, a MUD signature file for a corresponding MUD File
   MUST be available.  The MUD File MUST also include a reference to its
   MUD signature file via the 'mud-signature' statement.  A MUD
   signature MAY be referenced in the DevID, but entities consuming this
   information must be aware that a MUD File can change.  If MUD file
   changed (the MUD signature in the DevID does not match any more), a
   MUD signature file referenced in the MUD File itself MUST exist and
   MUST be available.  If both the signature embedded in a DevID and
   referenced by a MUD File do not match, the MUD File SHOULD NOT be
   trusted.

4.  Trusting MUD URIs and MUD Files

   The level of assurance about the integrity of a MUD URI embedded in a
   DevID is based on the level of trust put into the corresponding trust
   anchor associated with the DevID.  If you cannot establish a level of
   trust towards the entity that signed a DevID (the signer), the
   embedded MUD URI SHOULD NOT be trusted.

   The level of assurance about the integrity of a MUD file is based on
   the level of trust put into the entity that created the corresponding
   MUD File Signature.  If you cannot establish a level of trust put
   into the corresponding trust anchor associated with the MUD signature
   file, the referenced MUD File SHOULD NOT be trusted.

4.1.  Trusting RATS Resources referenced by a MUD File

   Reference Integrity Measurements and Endorsement documents that are
   referenced by a MUD File MUST be signed.  The signing procedures, the
   format of corresponding Identity documents, and the establishment of
   trust relationships associated with these resources are out-of-scope
   of this document.

5.  Specification of RATS MUD files referenced by MUD URIs

   The MUD URI embedded in a DevID presented by an Attester points to a
   MUD File.  At the time of writing this -00 I-D, MUD URIs always point
   to a piece of data that is a YANG-modeled XML file with a structure
   specified in the style of a YANG module definition ([RFC7950] and
   corresponding updates: [RFC8342], [RFC8526]).  This document
   specifies a YANG module augment definition for generic MUD files to
   create RATS MUD files.  The following definition MUST be used, if a
   MUD URI points to a RATS MUD file.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   Potentially

7.  Security Considerations

   Most likely a summary of the trust relationship corresponding to the
   RATS architecture
